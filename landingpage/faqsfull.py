    "What is Unibursal?":
    "Unibursal is a way for UVA students to rank things in a unique, dynamic way, much like the stock market. We're starting with undergrad classes, but as we grow, we’ll release a number of new tokens to be traded. You can think about it like this: you buy a token representing a class when you think its rank is going to rise, and sell when you think it's high enough.",

    "What is a token?":
    "A token is a virtual representation of an undergrad class. It's our unique analog to shares in the stock market, and it's also our way of quantifying opinion. When you buy a token, you're effectively Liking or Upvoting the class it represents, pushing its price up in relation to the other tokens. When you and others buy and sell tokens based on what you think/thought about a class, the market arrives at a ranking of classes that represents how everyone thinks.",

    "What value do I get from holding a token? Why would I want to buy one? What do I get?":
    "You have valuable, unique information - your opinion. You exchange that for a token, effectively quantifying that opinion, and pushing up the price of the token as a result (buy one token to move the price up slightly, buy a lot of tokens to move the price up a lot). We think of it as literally voting with your money. If your opinion turns out to be popular - if a certain course gets ranked higher as more people buy its token - then you and others who bought a token earlier can sell at a profit. Unlike in a traditional stock market, tokens aren’t financial assets with underlying cash flows, but these perfectly liquid tokens (see the next question) provide an effective incentive for participating in this exchange.",

    "How do I know I’ll be able to actually sell a token once I’ve bought it?":
    "We guarantee it. And this isn’t some kind of market-speak. The unique protocol that we use means that it's literally impossible to buy a token that you wouldn’t be able to sell - the tokens are perfectly liquid (shoot us an email if you want to see the math). Unlike a traditional stock market, our platform doesn’t require you to find a token-buyer on the other end if you’re selling, or a token-seller if you’re buying. You’re effectively exercising a vote with a token here, not holding onto financial securities.",

    "Why should I trust you?":
    "To put it frankly, you can trust us because we’re putting everything on the line to hold ourselves accountable to this platform and to you. So this is probably a great time to introduce ourselves. I’m Som, a cofounder of Unibursal, and a second-year at UVA studying economics and computer science. You can find me at sm2pvm@virginia.edu and (804)476-2867. And I’m Kevin, Unibursal’s other cofounder, and a second-year studying computer science and math. Feel free to reach out to ki4km@virginia.edu and (347)762-3113. We’re putting our names, our reputations, and our information out in the open to show you our commitment to an honest, transparent operation, so you can know we’re serious about holding ourselves accountable.",

    "Can I use Unibursal without buying or selling tokens?":
    "If you don’t buy/sell tokens, your opinion isn’t recorded in the market rankings or in the prices. But if you just want to see what other students think, you can still use Unibursal for that info without buying/selling.",

    "What moves prices?":
    "Short answer: you. Slightly longer answer: it’s supply-demand economics. When you buy a token, you’re pushing its demand up, and thus its price. When you sell, you’re decreasing its demand and price. An effectively large mass of users participating in the market moves its prices in a fashion that isn’t fully predictable.",

    "Do you make money?":
    "In the long run, probably, through negligible transaction fees. For now, we just want to see our platform grow. So right now, we’re actually losing money through other variable costs to ensure a seamless user experience for you.",

    "Where does my money go?":
    "When you deposit money in your account, your financial information is handled entirely by a trusted third party (so trusted, in fact, that it’s the same one used by Google, Amazon, and Target). We don’t store any of that information. Once the third-party authenticates your information, your account is loaded with the amount of cash you deposited. This account is stored both on our servers and off of it - that means that your financial information and money will stay safe even in the unlikely event of some sort of website compromise. After that, when you buy tokens, your cash is decreased by the cost of those tokens, and your token count increases. When you want to withdraw your money, the information once again gets handled by a trusted third party.",

    "Are you storing my credit card information? Is my money safe?":
    "We never store your credit card information in any capacity. When connecting your information to Unibursal, we use a trusted third-party to handle it (the very same one that DoorDash, Lyft, and Zoom use). We never see, store, or have access to any of your banking credentials or financial information. Even in the case of a full website compromise, your money and your financial information are untouched.",

    "How can I join/help?":
    "We’re creating an ecosystem, and we’re looking for computer scientists, finance specialists, designers, or anyone with an idea and a plan. If you’ve created something that could add any sort of direct or indirect functionality to Unibursal, shoot us an email today. Of course, you can also help us out simply by telling your friends about Unibursal (or posting on your story) and by contributing your opinions to our market.",

    "Are you tracking me/selling my personal data?":
    "Absolutely not. We’re interested in tracking prices, not you. And you can take that to the honor committee."

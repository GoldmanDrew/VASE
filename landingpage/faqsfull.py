"What is Have I Been Known?":
"HIBK checks your bitcoin address for transactions with 'privacy gotchas' that make them more likely to be known to surveillance. Based on the results you are matched with relevant obfuscation resources that can help improve your bitcoin privacy.",

"How does HIBK work?":
"A request is made to Blockstream's Esplora API to get recent transactions for your address. A response with JSON data for those transactions on the bitcoin blockchain is received. A privacy analysis script runs in your browser to identify any 'privacy gotchas' in the transactions.",

"Is HIBK tracking me?":
"No. HIBK is a static website hosted on Github Pages so there is no server side processing. API requests, responses, and privacy analysis all take place locally in your browser. No tracking scripts. Everything is open source on GitHub.",

"What is HIBK promoting?":
"You will notice there are no reflinks or affiliate links, nor is there any advertising present on HIBK, and there never will be. At most, some merchandise may be offered through a separate online store linked to from the menu at some point in future. The intent of HIBK is to promote proper privacy practices that protect the fungibility of bitcoin.",

"Why does HIBK link to certain exchanges?":
"Exchanging bitcoins for other coins - or what is referred to as 'Chain Hopping' - is one method of obfuscating coins for privacy. Exchanges linked to by HIBK are non-KYC exchanges bst suited to such use-cases.",
